## 2024-05-14 - Selective Loading on Paginated Views
**Learning:** The `welcome()` method previously optimized queries by explicitly selecting columns to exclude the `longText` `content` field, but the same optimization was missed in the `index()` method, leading to unnecessary memory overhead when returning paginated lists of articles.
**Action:** Always check related list/index views when one query is optimized for column selection, as other queries returning the same model might also suffer from large unselected payload sizes (especially with `longText`/blobs).

## 2024-05-15 - Missing Cache on Single Model Fetches
**Learning:** In read-heavy scenarios where the main page fetches articles from cache, the individual read views (e.g., `show()`) might still be hitting the database directly (`Article::findOrFail($id)`).
**Action:** When working on read-heavy models (like articles or blog posts), always cache the single model fetch using `Cache::remember("key_{$id}", ...)` and ensure the background command/job responsible for syncing the data correctly invalidates the specific key using `$model->wasChanged()` to clear `Cache::forget("key_{$id}")`.

## 2026-06-09 - [Fixing 500 Error on Model Attributes]
**Learning:** In Laravel, model attributes retrieved from the database that represent dates (like `published_at`) need to be explicitly cast to `datetime` in the model definition to prevent errors when trying to use Carbon methods (like `diffForHumans()`) on them in views.
**Action:** Always ensure that timestamp or date columns are correctly cast in the model to avoid runtime errors in views.

## 2026-06-10 - Missing Database Index on updateOrCreate Target Column
**Learning:** The `app/Console/Commands/FetchNewsCommand.php` uses `Article::updateOrCreate(['url' => $item['url']], ...)` which causes continuous lookups on the `url` column. Since the `url` column wasn't indexed, these lookups resulted in full table scans.
**Action:** When using `updateOrCreate()` or `firstOrCreate()` in a loop (like a scraper or importer command), always ensure that the criteria columns (the first array argument) are properly indexed to prevent O(N) database lookups on every iteration.
